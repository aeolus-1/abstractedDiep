# abstractedDiep

A simple clone of diep.io using raw python and socketio for multiplayer  
Rather slow, I tried multithreading but I don't know what im doing  

Needs aiohttp and socktio installed  
  
## To start  
Run app.py
  
## To play  
Open docs/index.html to access client  
Alternativly, run website.py for a locally hosted http client and goto [http://0.0.0.0:6969/](http://0.0.0.0:6969/)
